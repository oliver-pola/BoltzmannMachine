## Setup
We'll use pipenv as a virtual environment. To set everything up and run our MNIST restore experiment, start from here where the README.md is and do:

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv sync
pipenv shell
python mnist_restore_test.py
```

This will create a `data` folder with the MNIST dataset in subfolder `mnist` and a subfolder `mnist_restore_test` for the experiment results.

The required Python modules are listed in the provided `Pipfile` and installed via `pipenv install` command. To use the exact versions specified in `Pipfile.lock`, use `pipenv sync`. If you like to skip the virtual environment, you could also install all modules listed in  `Pipfile` via `pip install ...`.

## Results
The results are presented in our [Boltzmann Machine Paper](paper/boltzmann_machine_paper.pdf)

We were able to apply the Boltzmann Machine to recall a pattern. After learning on a very small subset of MNIST digits, we deleted the lower half of one image and used the Boltzmann Machine to restore that, according to the distributions it has learned.

Difficulties arise when expanding to more images and while tuning the parameters.
